Water quality detection
All living organisms on earth rely heavily on water as one of their primary sources of nutrition.
To ensure the stability and protection of the ecosystem, treated wastewater discharge quality must be 
monitored. Laboratories require a great deal of time and resources to collect and analyze water samples
Given access to data and machine learning algorithm models, this report aims to widely apply this computational power to distinguish between safe and unsafe water quality in a more efficient timeline.
Environmental and public health is directly impacted by water quality. In addition to drinking, water is used in agriculture and industry. To protect public health, access to safe drinking water is a fundamental human right.
If drinking water at an unsafe level, containing contaminants, it can potentially cost serious health issues such as gastrointestinal sickness, and chronic diseases such as cancer. 
There are different water contaminants that will affect the quality of water, such as industry and agriculture, human and animal waste, and even natural sources that will have an impact on the water quality.
This is an important health and development issue on an international, regional, and local level. To assure humans have their essential needs and maintain good health.
The reduction in adverse health effects and health care costs associated with investing in water supply and sanitation has been shown to outweigh their costs in some regions.
It is time-consuming and sometimes expensive to assess water quality using conventional laboratory techniques. Water quality can be predicted within a short timeframe using the algorithms proposed in this paper.
There are significant consequences of poor water quality for both aquatic life and the ecosystem as a whole.
We conducted this systematic review in order to identify the effectiveness of applying machine learning methodologies to estimate water quality parameters.
